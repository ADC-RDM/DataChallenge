    "Text collections and textual analysis offer a unique and largely untapped combination for applying data mining techniques and computational analysis to generate new insights into the past. This is particularly true for newspaper collections. Newspaper pages typically have eight times the amount of text that appears on a book page, and a modest weekly newspaper can represent many thousands of pages of local content for even the smallest of communities. The [Leddy Library](https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/) at the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca) has been digitizing local newspapers with partners for over a decade, including [The Amherstburg Echo](http://ink.scholarsportal.info/echo), [The Essex Free Press](http://ink.scholarsportal.info/efp), and [The Border Cities Star](http://ink.scholarsportal.info/bcs). With the help of the [Essex County Library System](https://www.countyofessex.ca/en/resident-services/library.aspx) and [Hackforge](https://hackf.org/), the [Academic Data Centre](https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/key-service-areas/academic-data-centre) is designating the month of March 2023 as an opportunity to encourage the use of local digitized historical newspapers for data mining and text analysis with 10 prizes of $50 Amazon gift cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This opportunity arose from a [workshop series](https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/rdm-tdm-jupyterhub-newspapers) on _Research Data Management_ and _Text Data Mining_ supported by [SHARCNET/Compute Ontario](https://www.sharcnet.ca/). Although the access to the newspapers is presented through a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook, there is no requirement to use Jupyter. Simply send us your code, snippets of code, URLs, or even ideas to [libdata@uwindsor.ca](mailto:libdata@uwindsor.ca). We are casting a broad net in the hopes of fostering ideas on the use of newspapers for research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets consist of the [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (OCR) for 5 newspapers titles, as shown in the table below. We have selected 3 titles from [Essex County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_Ontario) and 2 titles from [Chatham-Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham-Kent). These 2 neighbouring counties in Southern Ontario both have rich newspaper histories, and the titles are represented from the start of the newspapers through to 1950. Please note the gaps in coverage as shown in the table, it was not always possible to digitize all of the years in the newspaper's operation, and in some case, no record exists for the time period.\n",

    "This particular session attempts to bring together the use of textual analysis with digitized newspaper content within a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) environment. The session does not require background in any of these areas, but for those who may be attending this session without the benefit of the preceeding _Introduction to JupyterHub_ workshop, it is useful to understand some conventions of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout closely follows the format used by the [Newspapers as Data](https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/newspapers-as-data) project. Each newspaper has a zipped file that is available at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) which consists of a series of folders. The first folders are organized by year of publication. Within each year, there is a _pages_ folder, which contains a text file contain the OCR for each page of the newspaper issue organized by date and sequence number, e.g. _1907-08-23-0001.txt_. There is also a _volumes_ folder, which puts the OCR for an entire issue into one file, e.g. _1907-08-23.txt_. One may be preferable over the other, depending on what you are trying to do with the text. You can also view the [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) of a page using the method shown below. The page will contain embedded OCR. Newspapers, and in particular, historic newspapers from microfilm, can be extremely challenging for image and OCR quality. "
