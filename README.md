# Data Challenge
This opportunity arose from a [workshop series](https://leddy.uwindsor.ca/rdm-tdm-jupyterhub-newspapers) on _Research Data Management_ and _Text Data Mining_ supported by [SHARCNET/Compute Ontario](https://www.sharcnet.ca/). Although the access to the newspapers is presented through a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook, there is no requirement to use Jupyter. Simply send us your code, snippets of code, URLs, or even ideas to [libdata@uwindsor.ca](mailto:libdata@uwindsor.ca). We are casting a broad net in the hopes of fostering ideas on the use of newspapers for research.

The details are in the notebook. You can view it on GitHub or use it interactively through Binder.
